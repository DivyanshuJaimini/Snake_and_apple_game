## Introduction
The Snake and Apple Game is a fun and nostalgic game where the player controls a snake to eat apples that appear on the screen. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer. The objective is to keep the snake alive by avoiding collisions with itself.

This project is built using Python and employs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to enhance code modularity and readability. Pygame is used for rendering graphics and handling game events.
